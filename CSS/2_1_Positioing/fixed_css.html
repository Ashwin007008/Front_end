    <p>Types of images
Digital images
Digital images are stored as data, often from digital cameras or computer graphics. They are mainly of two types: 
Raster (or Bitmap) images: Composed of a grid of pixels. Their resolution depends on the number of pixels, and excessive enlargement can cause pixelation. Examples include JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
Vector images: Defined by mathematical equations representing shapes, lines, and curves. They can be scaled without quality loss and are used for logos, icons, and illustrations. 
Analog images
These are physical visual representations on materials like paper or canvas. Film photographs are created by light on a photosensitive surface. 
Optical images
In optics, an image is a reproduction of an object formed by light waves, such as a reflection. 
Mental images
An image can also be a mental picture, a memory, or an idea from imagination. 
Common uses of images
Digital imaging has significantly expanded the <h1>uses</h1> of images. 
Photography: Digital cameras allow easy capture, editing, and sharing of photos.
Entertainment: Images are used in video games, films, and virtual reality.
Medical imaging: Techniques like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans produce digital images for diagnosis.
Remote sensing: Satellites and drones capture digital images for various applications.
Computer vision: This AI field uses digital images to train computers for tasks like object recognition.
Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual reality (VR): Digital images are fundamental to both AR and VR technologies.
