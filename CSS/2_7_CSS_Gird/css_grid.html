<h1>CSS Grid</h1>
<h2>Horizontal( X - axis ) and Vertical Lines ( Y - axis )</h2>

<p>Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay out items in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.</p>
<br>
<p>CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.</p>
<br>
<p>When you want to align things in two dimensions, CSS Grid is the way to go. It is a powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a one-dimensional system.</p>
<br>
<p>To start using CSS Grid, you need to define a container element as a grid with the display property set to grid or inline-grid. Then, you can define the rows and columns of the grid using the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties.</p>
